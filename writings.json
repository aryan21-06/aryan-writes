      "content": "Thou soft whispers pass me like cold mountain breezes,\nYour presence is my refuge of warmth — yet you give me\nThose chilly shivers that run down my spine.\nOh my dear, my heart is electrified by them;\nNow it beats to your rhythm.\n\nWhen you are near, I feel an ocean of love within me,\nYet even this ocean seems a drop beside your love.\nThe waves within me sometimes fall still,\nAnd silence pervades the space —\nBut a thought of your love restores my strength;\nMy stillness in silence is born of your love."

      "content": "The heart aches, seeing—\nEvery night drowning in emptiness,\nEach day slipping by without love.\nTo survive this quagmire\nIs to fight a war every day,\nBetween the urge to be loved\nAnd the belief that I am unlovable.\n\nI do not seek sympathy;\nI seek peace in accepting the truth,\nTo pull myself away from this falseness\nThat drags me deeper into darkness.\n\nThe pain sharpens when someone shows affection;\nEven these small drops of happiness sting.\nDrops of water may make an ocean,\nBut these fragments of affection\nDo not lead me to love."
